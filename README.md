Implementation
* To build a scalable and highly available serverless web app on AWS that lets users upload chest xray and get the report from the Sagemaker predicting whether the X-ray is normal or having disease like Covid-19 / Pneumonia.
* Allowing user sign up and authentication, so we know who has uploaded the X-ray.
* Building an API server, so our front end has a way to load the appropriate chest X-ray.
* Storing data about X-ray images, and permissions of who can view what, so that our API has a fast and reliable place to query and save data to
Storing and serving images, so we have a place to put all of the images that users are uploading.

Pre-requisites
* An AWS account – An account with AWS is required. Creating an AWS account is free and gives you immediate access to the AWS Free Tier. 
* Node.js installed – JavaScript tools and packages are required for Node.js (and NPM, which comes with Node.js) to be installed. 
* The AWS Amplify CLI installed and configured – The AWS Amplify CLI helps you quickly configure serverless backends and includes support for authentication, analytics, functions, REST/GraphQL APIs, and more.
